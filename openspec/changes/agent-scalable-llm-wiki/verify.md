## Slice 1.1 — baseline and contracts

Baseline `7851161bf96312750d07b933ca5d42b75ce575c7` / tree
`b661e693e9c6656986fd431f4654df6db8dc3afc` contains 2,805 tracked entries. A Bun comparison
of every stored path/mode/blob tuple against `git ls-tree -r -z` reported
`exact tuple match: 2805 entries; referenced schema hashes match`.

The initial focused RED was `bun test src/contracts/contracts.test.ts` in
`tools/tool-wiki`: 0 pass, 9 fail after the wished-for API existed as an explicit
not-implemented boundary. The first full GREEN was 9 pass, 0 fail, 66 assertions; the
final suite extends that production-boundary matrix.

Every decoder fault below was injected separately, run through the real
`bun run src/cli.ts validate ...` subprocess used by the test, observed accepting the malformed
record, and restored. Each failed with `Expected: 1, Received: 0` after printing the shown line.

| Fault                                            | Observed malformed acceptance                         |
| ------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| committed selection tree made optional           | `valid candidate-inventory`                           |
| schema version widened                           | `valid candidate-entry`                               |
| relative membership grammar widened              | `valid granularity-policy`                            |
| integration mapping made optional                | `valid granularity-policy`                            |
| duplicate mapping-group guard removed            | `valid granularity-policy`                            |
| duplicate module guard removed                   | `valid module-mapping`                                |
| duplicate corpus/manifest outcome guards removed | `valid benchmark-corpus`; `valid experiment-manifest` |
| acceptance nonempty guard removed                | `valid benchmark-corpus`                              |
| three-seed minimum removed                       | `valid experiment-manifest`                           |
| raw usage or price identity made optional        | `valid invocation-receipt`                            |
| elapsed receipt duration made optional           | `valid elapsed-receipt`                               |
| receipt undeclared-key rejection removed         | `valid invocation-receipt` with `receiptBlob`         |
| exact-entry unique/sorted guards removed         | `valid candidate-inventory`                           |

`NX_DAEMON=false bunx nx typecheck tool-wiki --skip-nx-cache` rejected a deliberate source
error at `records.ts(4,7)` and a separate deliberate test error at
`contracts.test.ts(7,7)`, both TS2322 (`string` not assignable to `number`).
`NX_DAEMON=false bunx nx lint tool-wiki --skip-nx-cache` rejected an unused source binding;
direct ESLint output named `@typescript-eslint/no-unused-vars`. All faults were restored.

Nx could not create its sandbox socket and explicitly ran plugins in-process. This warning did
not skip targets. No full repository or browser gate was run for this isolated contract slice.

## Slice 1.1 fix round 1

The fixed corpus replaces `outcome.event-log-conformance`, whose event-log behavior already
existed at the baseline, with `outcome.source-certification-execution` from approved
`source-conformance-completion` task 7.2. Its acceptance runs the SQLite and memory source
certification targets separately. A Bun check parsed each source's `project.json` directly from
baseline `7851161b`; both lacked `test:conformance`, proving the outcome unmet at that revision.

New production CLI tests were RED before implementation: all four noncanonical path records,
all four invalid-instant/interval records, all four empty/blank outcome records, and a completed
invocation with `rawUsage: []` printed `valid ...` and returned exit 0. The fixed-corpus test was
also RED because the replacement outcome was absent. Individual restored fault injections then
observed these precise failures:

| Removed check                       | Production oracle observation                                                 |
| ----------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| canonical path narrow               | `[0, 0, 0, 0]`; three `valid candidate-entry`, one `valid granularity-policy` |
| real-instant narrow                 | invalid February instant returned 0 at position 1                             |
| invocation interval order           | reversed invocation returned 0 at position 2                                  |
| elapsed exact wall-clock difference | `elapsedMs: 59999` returned 0 at position 3                                   |
| check exact wall-clock difference   | `elapsedMs: 60001` returned 0 at position 4                                   |
| whitespace acceptance refusal       | corpus and manifest blank criteria returned 0 at positions 3/4                |
| benchmark nonempty outcome guard    | empty benchmark corpus returned 0 at position 1                               |
| manifest nonempty outcome guard     | empty manifest corpus returned 0 at position 2                                |
| completed raw-usage guard           | `valid invocation-receipt`; expected 1, received 0                            |

Receipt elapsed time now means exactly `Date.parse(endedAt) - Date.parse(startedAt)` in UTC
milliseconds, with real canonical UTC instants required. Invocation intervals require nondecreasing
end time. Completed invocation receipts require at least one raw usage entry; failed/censored
statuses remain distinct, and aggregation remains task 7.1.
